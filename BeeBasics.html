			<h2> Intro </h2>
			<p>Bees are flying insects that are known for their role in pollinating flowers while producing staples such as honey, beeswax, and propolis. There are over 20,000 known species of bees, and they can be found on every continent except Antarctica. </p>

			<h2> Anatomy </h2>
			<p> Bees have a unique anatomy. They have three body sections: They have the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.  The eyes and the antennae are attached to the head, the legs and wings are attached to the thorax, and the stinger is attached to the abdomen.</p>

			<h2> Hierarchy </h2>
			<p> Bees live in complex colonies. There are dfferent types of bees that serve different function to the hive. First, there is the worker bee. All worker bees are female and have stingers. They do most of the labor in the colony, including building the hive and the production of honey. Then there is the drone. There are a few drones per nest and they are all males with the sole purpose of fertilizing the queen. Lastly, there is the queen. She lays all the eggs in the colony and does no other work. </p>

			<h2> Life Cycle </h2>
			<p> Every bee starts off as an egg that is laid by the queen. When the egg finally hatches, it turns into a larva, which in essence, is a baby bee. The larva gets fed until it grows into an adult bee. What the adult bee becomes, however, is peculiar. Bees can decide to feed larvae a mixture of pollen and nectar, which is what their normal food is, and will turn into a worker or a drone. If a female larva is fed with what is known as "royal jelly", the larva will then turn into a queen. Bees have control over who will become queen or not, depending on if they are ready to spread the colony elsewhere, or if the current queen is in critical condition. </p>
