				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p>Ants are amazing little insects that live in big groups. There are thousands
                        of different kinds all over the world. Even though they're small, they do a
                        lot of important jobs like finding food and building homes. They work together
                        really well and have cool ways to talk to each other. Scientists love studying
                        them because they're so interesting and have a big impact on nature.</p>

				<h2> Hierarchy </h2>
				<p> A hierarchy is a system that sectionides anything by their ranks or jobs. Ants also have their own sort of hierarchy, although each step is equally important. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3> Queen </h3>
						<p> First, we have the queen. She is responsible for laying all of the eggs in the colony. Without her, all of the ants would die off without being replaced, and the colony would die. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Drones </h3>
						<p> Next, we have the drones. They are the male ants and their sole purpose is to fertilize the queens eggs. They don't do any work around the colony so most other species kick them out. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Workers </h3>
						<p> Then, we have the worker ants. All of the workers do exactly as they are named: work. They dig the tunnels, take out the trash, nurse the younger ants, etc. Soldier ants are also considered worker ants because they are females that do work around the hive. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Brood </h3>
						<p> Lastly, we have the brood. Ant eggs and ant larvae fall under this category. They don't do much, but they are the next generation of workers, soldiers, drones, and queens. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Communication </h2>
				<p>
					Ants require communication to know where they are, where others are, and lots of other things. There are three main ways that ants cann communicate.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3> Pheremones </h3>
						<p>
							Ants have pheromone sensors on them. They also can release pheromones at their will, depending on what they are trying to portray. This differs from smell because pheromones are most of the time chemical signals and sometimes odorless.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Tactile Interactions </h3>
						<p>
							Ants touch antennae to communicate. They can exchange information such as what job they are doing, or even if they are from the same colony.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3> Sounds and Vibrations </h3>
						<p>
							Ants have a very sensitive sense of touch. This leads to them detecting even the smallest vibrations. They can detect if an animal is walking nearby and respond accordingly.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
